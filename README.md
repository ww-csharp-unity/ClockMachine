# ClockMachine
A machine designed to keep time in a video game environment that otherwise doesn't have any concept of time built in.

This machine was developed in response to a lack of easily accessible time keeping functions within Unity's game development environment. This script will start a timer that counds seconds since the start of the script. From that counter the script determines minutes, hours, total seconds, and subseconds.
